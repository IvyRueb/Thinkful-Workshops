## Why Guessing Game

The guessing game is a great intro into js for people who are really interested in the logical aspect of programming. It will give you a base fundamental understanding of functions, variables & conditionals.

## How Guessing Game Works

[the deck][slideshow-url]
We will be teaching this by going over the base fundamental understanding of functions, variables & conditionals. Starting from the ground up which will allow them by the end to build a guessing game.

## Guessing Game

* What we are making
  * [Starter Code][start-code]
* Define A Variable
  * `let numberOfSheep = 20`
  * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/jKmgJW?editors=0011)
* Declaring A Function
  * `function greet(){ return 'hello world' }`
  * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/WyjVmv?editors=0012)
* Conditionals
  * Example
    ```js
    function familyRoadTrip() {
      if (needGas === true){
        getGas()
      } else {
        keepDriving()
      }
    }
    ```
  * Comparing Values
    * ===
    * !==
    * >
    * <
    * =>
    * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/EEdvwW)
* Parameters With Functions
  * Example
    ```js
    function adder(a,b) {
      return a + b
    }
    adder(1,2)
    ```
