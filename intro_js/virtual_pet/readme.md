## How Virtual Pet Works

[the deck][slideshow-url]

Through a series of interactive slides, weâ€™ll learn the fundamentals of Javascript. They are Variables, Functions & Conditionals. We will explore each one and talk about the importance and how it all plays into the bigger picture of coding

## Virtual Pet

* What we are making
  * [Starter Code][start-code]
* Defining a variable
  * `let firstVariable = 20`
* More about variables
  * [Drill](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/RBapwJ?editors=0012#0)
  ``` javascript
  var firstVar = 20;
  var secondVar = firstVar + 1;

  console.log(secondVar);
  ```
* Defining Functions
  ```javascript
  function greet() {
    return "Hello World"
  }
    ```

* Working Basic Functions
  * [Drill](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/WyjVmv)
  ``` javascript
  function subtract() {
    return 10 - 5;
  }

  console.log(subtract());
  ```
* Intoduce our pet Object
  * `let pet_info = {"name":"Thinkpup", "weight":0, "happiness":0}`
* Working with objects
  * `let pet_info = {"name":"Thinkpup", "weight":0, "happiness":0}`
  * Retrieve & change values
  * Square bracket Notation
  * Dot notation
* Conditionals
  * [Drill](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/oyOBEe)
  ```javascript
  function petWeight() {
    let pet_weight = 6;
    if (pet_weight > 10) {
      console.log("Your pet is obese.");
    } else {
      console.log("Your pet is in great shape.");
    }
  }
  petWeight();
  ```


## Summarize

Virtual Pet will help your potential students see the power of the fundamental and gain confidence in the fact they can do this. Variables, Functions & Conditionals are of the most important because they are the fundamentals of everything we do in coding. Overall enjoy the experience helping people out and remember to gauge the audience as you go
