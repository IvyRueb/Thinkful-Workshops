## Why Arrays & Loops

Seldom do we receive our data in the specific format that we would like it. Whether it originates from a 3rd party API, or even within our own application, more often than not, we’re going to need to manipulate our data to get it exactly how we want it. 

## How this works

[The deck](https://github.com/IvyRueb/Thinkful-Workshops/blob/master/array_loops/Array_Loops_Slides.pdf)

Through this workshop we will be educating them on some of the fundamental data structures in programming and how to manipulate them. Have them follow along with all of the exercises and encourage them to ask questions throughout the workshop. We will be giving the students a take home problem at the end.

## Content

* Array Basics
  * Arrays are zero-indexed lists that allow us to store a variety of data in a simple linear format
  * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/MPaaBN?editors=0012
  * for Loops
    * The most common and powerful type of loop
    * Cover 3 essential parts of loop - starting value, ending condition, incrementer (or decrementer)
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/MPKKag?editors=0011
  * while Loops
    * loops that run until a certain condition is met
      * BEWARE OF INFINITE LOOPS
      * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/gBPPLj?editors=0012
  * forEach / map
    * forEach and map are very similar, but it’s important to distinct the differences
      * forEach is directly manipulating the array it’s called upon
      * map creates a copy of the array it's called upon
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/yReeby?editors=0012
  * reduce
    * Reduce is useful for condensing our entire array down to one single value 
    * Make sure to cover accumulator, current value, and initial value (optional)
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/QZKQme
  * filter 
    * returns a new array with items that meet the criteria given in the callback
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/PyGQBX?editors=0011
  * push / pop / shift / unshift
    * Knowing the shorthand for inserting / removing the first and last items in an array can prove very useful
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/LgRQXe?editors=0012
  * slice
    * Slice will produce a shallow copy of the array you’re acting on, while returning an array of the items specified
    * Cover inclusive first argument and optional / exclusive second argument
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/EdgQMX
* Object Basics
  * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/QZKQXb?editors=0012
  * Object.keys
    * returns an array of all the object's keys
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/PyGRPr?editors=0011
  * for in / for of
    * for in - loops over object keys
    * for of - loops over object values
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/oazqbM?editors=0012
  * Object.hasOwnProperty()
    * Returns a boolean stating whether the given object possesses a particular property / key
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/NORYdx?editors=0012
  * JSON
    * parse and stringify
    * Drill - https://codepen.io/chrisbridges/pen/bmwvRE?editors=0012

## Summarize

These are just some of the common ways data can be structured and manipulated, but there are many more! Always be willing to Google and read documenatation for even better ways of solving your particular need.
