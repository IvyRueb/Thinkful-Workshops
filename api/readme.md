## Why API's 

Our websites become much more fun and interactive once weâ€™re able to pull data from outside sources. APIs allow us to send messages to our friends, check the weather, and get directions home - amongst countless others!

## How this works

Through this workshop we will be educating them on basic APIs and how to integrate them. Have them follow along with all of the exercises and encourage them to ask questions throughout the workshop. We will be giving the students a take home problem at the end.

## APIs

* What is an API?
  * Application Programming Interface
    * going to allow our app to pull data from an external source
* RESTful
  * REpresentational State Transfer
* CRUD Operations
  * GET
  * PUT
  * POST
  * DELETE
* Endpoints
  * URL we make our request to
* JSON
  * JavaScript Object Notation
  * Easy data type to work with
* AJAX
  * Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
* Params
  * an object that we send with our request
* Drill - https://github.com/chrisbridges/random-quote-machine/tree/take_home_drill
  * "Take Home Drill" branch is for the drill
  * Master Branch contains solution

## Summarize

APIs allow our programs to communicate with other software. This allows us to pull in outside data, add functionality, and generally make our apps more fun and interesting.
