## Why Javascript Fundamentals

This is a great place to start from no previous knowledge at all. Because we start by talking about the bigger picture and how that moves into coding.

## How Javascript Fundamentals Works

[the deck][slideshow-url]

We will be doing this by talking about how everything works from the browsers they know and love. Then taking them through the fundamentals of JS to get them going.

## Javascript Fundamentals

* What we are making
  * [Starter Code][start-code]
* Client VS Server
  * Client sends requests. #frontenddevelopers
  * Server sends responses. #backenddevelopers
  * Example - facebook 
* Define A Variable
  * `let numberOfSheep = 20`
  * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/jKmgJW?editors=0011)
* Declaring A Function
  * `function greet(){ return 'hello world' }`
  * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/Iyvonne/pen/WyjVmv?editors=0012)
* Conditionals
  * Example
    ```js
    function familyRoadTrip() {
      if (needGas === true){
        getGas()
      } else {
        keepDriving()
      }
    }
    ```
