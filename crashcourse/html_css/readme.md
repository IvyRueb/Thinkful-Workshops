[the deck][slideshow-url]

We will be doing this by talking about how everything works from the browsers they know and love. Then walking them through the basics of the html structure to style sheets.

## HTML & CSS

* What we are making
  * [Starter Code][start-code]
* How Web Works
  * Type Url From Client ex. google.com
  * Browser sends http request
  * Browser receives files & renders them
* Client VS Server
  * Client sends requests. #frontenddevelopers
  * Server sends responses. #backenddevelopers
  * Example - facebook
* HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
  * `<h1>Hi There!</h1>`
    * Opening Tag, Content, Closing Tag = H1 Tag
  * `<a href="www.google.com">google</a>`
    * Opening Tag, Attribute, Content, Closing Tag = A Tag
  * `<p class="large">google</p>`
    * Opening Tag, Class, Content, Closing Tag = P Tag
  * HTML STRUCTURE
    * DOCTYPE, HTML, HEAD, BODY
  * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/)
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
  * Examples
  ```css
  h1 { color:blue; }
  .purple {
    color:purple;
  }
  .link {
    color: yellow;
    text-decoration:none
  }
  .centered {
    text-align:center;
  }
  ```

  * [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/)
  * Margin, Border & Padding
    * Content - the content of the box, where text and images appear
    * Padding - Clears an area around the content. padding is transparent.
    * Border - A border that goes around the padding & content
    * Margin - Clears an area outside the border. the margin is transparent.
